#plan option 2:
#ask user their username
#show one card named 'dog ranker'
#when user clicks on 'begin' button on the card they are taken to another page and shown 1 photo at a time (15 total?) of dogs and are asked to rank them from 1-10 stars
#user's choices are added to a list (??) 
#at the end top 3 dogs ranked on the list are presented to the user
#user is given an option to click on the top 3 dogs and find out more about them (card flip animation?)
#user is presented with a button to click back to ask username page, and 'signed out'
