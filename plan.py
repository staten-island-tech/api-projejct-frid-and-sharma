# open to home screen
# ask user their username 
# list 3 optio
# ns as cards for games: foxes, dogs, ducks 
# when user clicks on a game send them to a diff page w a random picture of animal (animal=which game they picked) and 10 'empty' stars
# have user select however many stars they rank animal and then button 'submit'
# once user selects 'submit' repeat process
# do this a total of 15-20 times (figure this out later)
# at the end, show top 5 pics according to all users who have played this game
# show list of all players (usernames)
# show 'back to home' button
# when user selects 'back to home' button, send them back to the three cards. if they click on animal they just played, show an error page (ex: already played! choose anothe one or log out)
# if they choose another one repeat the process
#take the top 3 animals from each users selection and save them to a database (list?????????) so that the next user will see not just their results, but the average results of theirs and everyone else who came before
# if they log out go back to username input screen


#plan option 2:
#ask user their username
#show one card named 'dog ranker'
#when user clicks on 'begin' button on the card they are taken to another page and shown 1 photo at a time (15 total?) of dogs and are asked to rank them from 1-10 stars
#user's choices are added to a list (??) 
#at the end top 3 dogs ranked on the list are presented to the user
#user is given an option to click on the top 3 dogs and find out more about them (card flip animation?)
#user is presented with a button to click back to ask username page, and 'signed out'
