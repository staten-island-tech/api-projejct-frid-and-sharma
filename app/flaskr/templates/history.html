    <h1 class="h1big"> A (very) Brief History Of Dog Breeding </h1>
</div>

<div class="center">
    <h1 class="h1a"> Dogs were first domesticated around 15,000 years ago. Approximately 14,000 years ago, humans began to selectively breed them. Dogs with traits seen as desirable were chosen to breed in the hope of them passing on said traits to their offspring. Over many rounds of defining a desirable trait through this process, the trait becomes fixed. As humans continued to do this to dogs, breeds branched off, some lost forever, and some every so slowly changing into those we know today. In modern day, there are over 400 recognized dog breeds. </h1>
